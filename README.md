# Human-Digital-Twin-for-Early-Detection-and-Monitoring-of-Osteoarthritis-using-Deep-Learning.
Human Digital Twin for Early Detection and Monitoring of Osteoarthritis using Deep Learning  🔹 Idea in Simple Words:  A Digital Twin is a virtual copy of a human body (or joint) that continuously learns from medical data like X-rays, MRI scans, or movement data.
# 🧠 Human Digital Twin for Early Detection and Monitoring of Osteoarthritis using Deep Learning

## 📘 Overview
This project builds a **Human Digital Twin** model to detect and monitor **Osteoarthritis (OA)** from **MRI/X-ray images** using deep learning and Explainable AI (Grad-CAM).

A **Digital Twin** acts as a virtual replica of the human knee joint that continuously learns from medical data, helping doctors track OA progression and personalize treatment.

## 🧩 Project Workflow
| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing** | Images resized (224x224), normalized, and augmented for training. |
| **2️⃣ Model Training** | Trained CNN (ResNet50/MobileNetV2) to classify images into Healthy, Early OA, and Severe OA. |
| **3️⃣ Evaluation** | Accuracy and loss evaluated on test data. |
| **4️⃣ Grad-CAM Visualization** | Highlights affected knee regions that led to OA prediction. |
| **5️⃣ Human Digital Twin** | Virtual representation of the patient’s knee condition using model outputs and Grad-CAM heatmaps. |
